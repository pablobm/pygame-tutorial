      <h1>Mouse events</h1>
      <p>To know when the player is using the mouse, we use events. For example, when the player moves the mouse, an event of type <code>pygame.MOUSEMOTION</code> joins the event queue. It will include useful information, such as its position or what buttons were pressed.</p>

<p>This is an example of use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MOUSEMOTION</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The mouse moved&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The X position is now&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pos</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The Y position is now&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pos</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is what the program does:</p>

<ol>
<li>It loops through every event in the event queue.</li>
<li>For each event, it checks if its about mouse movement.</li>
<li>If it&#39;s about mouse movement, we print a message telling us, as well as two other messages reporting its position.</li>
</ol>

<p>Challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try the example above in your program. Where do you think it goes?</li>
<li>Ensure that the program responds both to mouse movement and to the window being closed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The position of the mouse (and a bit about lists)</h2>

<p>The example above does something strange to read the position. It uses <code>event.pos[0]</code> and <code>event.pos[1]</code>, which look a bit complicated. Let&#39;s look into that.</p>

<p>Each <code>event</code> comes with a few things inside. For example, it has <code>event.type</code>, which tells what type of event it is. Remember that the dot <code>.</code> means &quot;inside&quot;, so the <code>type</code> is something inside <code>event</code>, therefore we use it as <code>event.type</code>. The same with <code>MOUSEMOTION</code>: it lives inside <code>pygame</code>, so we refer to it as <code>pygame.MOUSEMOTION</code>.</p>

<p>Apart from the type, each event will have other things inside, which depend on the type of event. A <code>MOUSEMOTION</code> event has a <code>pos</code>, which is the position of the mouse. This position is represented as a list of two elements: X and Y.</p>

<p>Remember how lists work? This is an example of a list with two elements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">position</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">123</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">456</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>We have seen how to loop through a list and do something with each element, but we haven&#39;t seen how to work with a specific element of the list. For example, how to do something only with the first element, or only with the hundredth element. Let&#39;s see that.</p>

<p>Computers have a funny way to count. When people count (for example with their fingers), we start counting at 1, and then go 2, 3, 4... Computers don&#39;t do that: they normally start at 0 and then go 1, 2, 3... This is important now. For a computer, the first element of a list is the element number 0, and the second element is the element number 1. The 100th element is element 99 and so on.</p>

<p>We can read inside a list using square brackets <code>[]</code> and a number, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">position</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">123</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">456</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The first element is &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">position</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The second element is &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">position</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s see how well you understood all that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a program where you move a small image using the mouse.

<ul>
<li>Nothing complicated: simply that the image will be in the same position as the mouse.</li>
<li>You will have to read the mouse position from the event, and use it to set the position to the image.</li>
<li>If you follow the example from the &quot;Objects&quot; chapter, you should be able to do something like <code>actor.x = event.pos[0]</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
