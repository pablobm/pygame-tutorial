      <h1>Drawing something on the screen</h1>
      <p>So far, our program is only showing a blank screen. Let&#39;s draw an image on it.</p>

<h2>Waiting</h2>

<p>At the moment, the program opens an window and closes it immediately. We should make the window stay open for a bit first.</p>

<p>To make Python wait a bit before ending, we need to load a library that gives us that ability. The one we need now is called <code>time</code>, and includes code to help us deal with time. We can import it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Inside the <code>time</code> library, there&#39;s a function called <code>sleep</code>. This function makes the program stop for a number of seconds. For example, to stop the program for 5 seconds, you would do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">time</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<ol>
<li>Where do you think the <code>import</code> and the <code>sleep</code> lines go in the program? Try to add them so that the window is open for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>How would you get the window to stay open for 10 seconds instead?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting hold of the screen</h2>

<p>It&#39;s time to draw an image on the screen. Find an image you would like to draw, and put the file in the same folder as the code.</p>

<p>First we need to get hold of the screen. When we create a screen (a window) with <code>set_mode</code>, the function &quot;returns&quot; a screen. This means we can create a variable and store the screen there. <strong>Modify</strong> the existing code to do this when it creates the window:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">screen</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">display</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_mode</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">800</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">600</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The function <code>set_mode</code> (which lives inside <code>display</code>, which in turn lives inside <code>pygame</code>) returns a result. We use the <code>=</code> symbol to give a name to this result. In this case, the result is an &quot;object&quot; that represents the screen. We call it <code>screen</code>, but we could have given it any other name. The important thing is that we give it a name that is easy to remember later.</p>

<h2>Loading the image</h2>

<p>Next, we have to load the image and give it a name too. This is the line for that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">image</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;my-image.png&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>In this example, the image file is called <code>my-image.png</code>. It will be different for you. Make sure to type the name of the file you want to load.</p>

<p>What the line does is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>It uses the function <code>pygame.image.load</code> to load an image into memory.</li>
<li>The function knows what image to read because we tell it the name of the file: &quot;my-image.png&quot;. It will be different in your case.</li>
<li>The function &quot;returns&quot; an &quot;object&quot; that represents the image in the program.</li>
<li>We give a name to this &quot;object&quot; so that we can use it later. We call it <code>image</code>, using the equals <code>=</code> symbol. We could have called it anything else.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we draw the image on the screen. To do this, we use the function <code>blit</code>, which lives inside the object that we called <code>screen</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">screen</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">blit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>&quot;Blit&quot; is a technical term, don&#39;t worry too much about the funny word. What it means here is &quot;draw the thing we called <code>image</code> on the thing we called <code>screen</code>&quot;.</p>

<h2>Actually displaying the result</h2>

<p>There&#39;s one last hitch. Pygame doesn&#39;t show things on screen as you draw them. Instead it waits until you tell it to do it. This can be a bit annoying at first, but it is much faster because it allows the computer to do less work.</p>

<p>Once you have drawn the image on the screen, you tell Pygame that the screen is ready by running this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">display</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">flip</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<ol>
<li>Where do you think you have to add the lines above on the program? Try adding them yourself and see where they would go.</li>
<li>Make the image appear in the centre of the screen</li>
<li>Draw the image four times on the screen, so that it appears on each of the four corners</li>
</ol>
