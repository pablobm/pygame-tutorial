      <h1>Keyboard without events</h1>
      <p>There are actually two different ways of checking if the player is pressing keys. One is with events, as we have seen. We&#39;ll see the second one next.</p>

<p>The function <code>pygame.key.get_pressed()</code> will get us a list of all keys that are pressed at the time. We use it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">keys</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_pressed</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">keys</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pygame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">K_LEFT</span><span class="p">]:</span>
  <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;The LEFT arrow is pressed&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is how the above works:</p>

<ol>
<li>We get the list of the keys that are pressed right now. We put it in the variable <code>keys</code>.</li>
<li>We look into this list using square brakets. With <code>keys[pygame.K_LEFT]</code> we check if the left arrow was pressed.</li>
<li>If this is true (if the left arrow was pressed), we print a message.</li>
</ol>

<p>This example uses <code>pygame.K_LEFT</code> same as we were using it earlier with events. The same will work for any other key.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>pygame.key.get_pressed</code> to program the movement of a character (an image) on the screen.</li>
<li>Ensure that you can also close the program by clicking on the &quot;close&quot; button of the window, or pressing Q, using events.</li>
<li>Integrate the starfield of previous chapters on this game, so that the stars serve as background to your character.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Should we use keyboard events or not?</h2>

<p>As you can see, there are two ways of reading the keyboard. Which one is better? The answer is &quot;it depends&quot;. You will use one or the other depending on the situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the key can be kept pressed for a continuous action, use <code>pygame.key.get_pressed()</code>. For example, for movement.</li>
<li>If the key should be pressed only once at a time, use events. For example, for a jump or a throw, or for pausing the game.</li>
</ul>
