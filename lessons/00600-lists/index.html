      <h1>Lists, part 1</h1>
      <p>Chances are that our programs won&#39;t have just one thing to draw, but many. We could have a hundred characters moving around, and we don&#39;t want to write code for each and every one of them. It would be boring and time-consuming.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can make &quot;lists&quot; of things. When we have lists, we can write code to deal with everything on the list, regardless of whether the list has one item or a thousand.</p>

<h2>A bit of theory: lists</h2>

<p>Start a new program from scratch. Type it as follows:</p>

<p>The words <code>for</code> and <code>in</code> above are special. They create a loop, similar to the ones we have already seen. We use this construct to loop over lists. We could do it with <code>while</code> too, but it&#39;s easier this way.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the program. What does it do?</li>
<li>How does it work?</li>
<li>Add other items to the list and run the program.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use variables when creating a list:</p>

<p>You can even have lists of lists:</p>

<h2>Back to Pygame: moving many things</h2>

<p>Now we are going to use two concepts we just learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Objects: to keep together details related to each thing on the screen.</li>
<li>Lists: to deal with many things at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s try again to build a Pygame program from scratch. Start with a blank Python file and write code for each of the following, one at a time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Import Pygame into the program.</li>
<li>Define the color black as a constant.</li>
<li>Initialize Pygame</li>
<li>Create a screen window and put it in a variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, it&#39;s all stuff we have done before. Next let&#39;s apply some of what we saw in the chapter about objects:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define a class <code>Actor</code>.</li>
<li>Create an actor and put it in the variable <code>actor1</code>.</li>
<li>Set the <code>x</code> and the <code>y</code> coordinates for the actor. Use any numbers you like.</li>
<li>Set an image for this actor. Choose any image you like.</li>
<li>Create a second actor, <code>actor2</code>, with the same image, but different coordinates.</li>
<li>Create a list <code>actor_list</code> that has both <code>actor1</code> and <code>actor2</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>OK so far? Here comes the interesting part. After the code above, write code for the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>A loop that runs 300 times. Each time it will do all the steps below:

<ol>
<li>Paint the screen completely black.</li>
<li>For each actor in <code>actor_list</code>, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Increase the <code>y</code> coordinate.</li>
<li>&quot;Blit&quot; the image for the actor on the screen.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>&quot;Flip&quot; the screen to update it.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Come on, get typing. I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<p>OK, how did it go? If you are having trouble, remember to address one thing at a time. Don&#39;t try to write all at once. Review the previous lessons if you need.</p>
