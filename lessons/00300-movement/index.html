      <h1>Creating movement</h1>
      <p>To get images moving, we&#39;ll need to draw them many times, very fast, each time in a slightly different position. This way, we create an illusion of an object moving. We can use a loop to get this effect.</p>

<h2>A bit of theory: Loops</h2>

<p>In Python, the word <code>while</code> is used to create a loop. Start a new program from scratch. Type it as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the program. What does it do?</li>
<li>How does it work?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Back to Pygame: Moving the image</h2>

<p>We had to stop for a moment to learn loops because we need them to create animations. Now let&#39;s go back to the program we were writing with Pygame. It&#39;s time to use this knowledge.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of steps. Each one explains a line of the program we are going to write.
Translate each step into a line of code (revisit the previous lessons to remember how to do all this):</p>

<ol>
<li>Import Pygame into the program</li>
<li>Initialize Pygame</li>
<li>Create a screen window and give it a name</li>
<li>Load an image into memory</li>
</ol>

<p>When you are done with it, it&#39;s time to make the image move. To this program we just wrote, we are going to add code to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Draw the image on the screen 100 times, in different positions</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not going to be only one line of code, but several. You will have to combine the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code for the loop at the beginning of this chapter.</li>
<li>Code to draw images on the screen as seen on previous chapters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Go on, give it a whirl.</p>

<h2>Deleting the previous frame</h2>

<p>If you did everything correctly, you should have an image moving across the screen, but leaving a &quot;wake&quot; behind it. How can we avoid this?</p>

<p>The problem here is that we are drawing on top of the previous screen. Instead, we need to make sure that the screen is deleted before we start painting a new frame. You can use the following piece of code, which paints the whole screen black:</p>

<p>Where do you think that line should go?</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<ol>
<li>Get the image moving horizontally.</li>
<li>Get the image moving vertically.</li>
<li>Get the image moving diagonally.</li>
<li>Any one of the above, but faster.</li>
<li>Get the image to start from the bottom right corner and move up.</li>
<li>Get the two identical images moving on the screen in different directions.</li>
<li>Get two different images moving on the screen in different directions.</li>
</ol>
